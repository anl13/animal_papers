## Animal Paper Collection (Ongoing)

Recently, markerless animal motion capture attracts more and more attention in computer vision community. Inspired by remarkable techniques for markerless human motion capture, a few excellent literatures appear for animal modeling and reconstruction such as [SMAL](http://smal.is.tue.mpg.de/
) and [DeepLabCut](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut). However, there are still many challenges before computer vision methods are reliable in industry-grade for capturing natural motion of arbitary animals robustly and efficiently. Therefore, I contribute this repository to track every small step towards the ultimate goal for animal reconstruction, willing to witness further achievements in this area.

**Animal Paper Collection** is an academic paper collection mainly covering computer vision papers which aim at markerless animal motion capture or 3D reconstruction.
