## Animal Paper Collection (Ongoing)

Recently, markerless animal **motion capture** and **3D reconstruction** attracts more and more attention in computer vision community. Inspired by remarkable techniques for markerless human motion capture, a few excellent literatures appear for animal modeling and reconstruction such as [SMAL](http://smal.is.tue.mpg.de/
) and [DeepLabCut](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut). However, there is still a long way before computer vision methods could capture natural motion of arbitary animals in industrial-grade. 

Therefore, I contribute this repository to track every step towards the ultimate goal of high quality animal capture.
