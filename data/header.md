## Animal Paper Collection

Since 2017, animal reconstruction attracts more and more attention from computer vision community. Inspired by remarkable techniques for human markerless motion capture and performance capture, we have witnessed some excellent pioneering literatures for animal reconstruction like [SMAL]() and [DeepLabCut](). However, there are still many challenges before we could rely on computer vision methods to capture natural motion of arbitary animals robustly in real-time. Thus, I build this repository to track every step towards the ultimate goal for animal reconstruction in computer vision community. 

**Animal Paper Collection** is an academic paper collection mainly covering computer vision papers which aim at animal markerless motion capture or 3D reconstruction.
